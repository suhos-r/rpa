# UiPath Solution & Artifact Reviewer

Review UiPath solutions and artifacts for structural validity, quality, best practices, optimization, correctness, and business alignment. Produce a structured review report with findings and recommendations.

## When to Use

Use for requests to review, audit, check, evaluate, improve, quality-gate, or understand the business value or architecture of a UiPath project, solution, or artifact; artifact-type best-practice reviews; and inheritance of an existing solution.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read-only.** Never manually modify files. The sole exception is mandatory `uip agent refresh` for low-code agents; it may update derived files, which must not be restored or cleaned up. Report fixes and route them to `uipath-rpa`, `uipath-agents`, `uipath-maestro-flow`, `uipath-maestro-bpmn`, `uipath-api-workflow`, `uipath-coded-apps`, `uipath-platform`, or `uipath-solution`.
2. **Validate first.** Every RPA entry point requires `uip rpa validate`, plus a project-level `uip rpa build` — `build` compiles the whole project, including entry points `validate` was never pointed at, so a clean per-file `validate` can still fail `build`. Low-code agents require `uip agent refresh` then `uip agent validate`; use `uip maestro flow validate`, `uip maestro bpmn validate`, and `uip api-workflow validate` as applicable. Every CLI validation command uses `--output json`. Report each command's Error, Warning, and Info counts; detail every Error and Warning, but add no detail lines for clean results. A review without both RPA `validate` and `build` is incomplete.
3. Discover and classify every project before reviewing any project.
4. Classify findings as **Critical** (blocks deployment), **Warning** (should fix), or **Info** (improvement opportunity).
5. Establish or infer business context before optimization; queues and additional components are not automatically better.
6. Do not duplicate validation findings. Reference the output rule ID and message rather than restating checks or passes. Counts include all results; Errors and Warnings also receive detail lines.
7. Limit analysis to 30 minutes. For solutions with 10+ projects, provide a summary and deep dives for the three highest-risk projects, offering the remainder separately.
8. Every agent requires `uip agent review` or `uip codedagent review` first, followed by the applicable judgment catalog, including when review began before this skill loaded; merge prior findings only after both passes.
9. Review-CLI findings are authoritative. Preserve `RuleId`, `Severity`, `Description`, `File`, and `SuggestedFix` verbatim. Format `Recommendation` as `<File>: <Description>. <SuggestedFix>`. Judgment findings use the same format. Map `error` to Critical, `warning` to Warning, and `info` to Info; `judgment` defaults to Warning and may change only with reasoning in the finding description.
10. Put intended but unapplied rules in **Rules Skipped**, including missing tooling/files, unavailable review CLI, and `status: deferred`. Do not list non-applicable rules.
11. Never invent `rule_id` values. Each cited ID must occur verbatim in a loaded `references/agents/agents-*-rules.md` catalog or review-CLI JSON. Verify every ID before reporting. A real Critical issue covered by neither source is reported without a `rule_id`; unrule'd Warnings and Infos are dropped. This governs agent findings.
12. Grade agent projects only with `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `F`, with no `+`/`-`, per agent and overall: `min(G_det, G_jud)`. Read `G_det` from review CLI `Data.Grade`; do not recompute it. Compute `G_jud` from judgment findings only. Show the binding constraint for every grade; low-code reports omit the printed derivation as required by the rubric. A security or data-integrity judgment Critical forces F. The skill grade cannot exceed `Data.Grade`; report both. Do not grade RPA, flows, or coded apps. See [references/agents/agent-grading-rubric.md](references/agents/agent-grading-rubric.md).
13. `uip agent refresh` owns `.agent-builder/`, `.local/build/`, and, for low-code agents, regenerated root `entry-points.json` from `agent.json`. Do not open these contents. Exclude them from classification, authored-file selection, structural metrics, and manual checks. Report a defect only if refresh fails to fix them. Read low-code schemas from `agent.json` `.inputSchema` and `.outputSchema`.

## Review Workflow

### Step 0 — Discover, Scope, and Locate the PDD

#### 0a. Probe the Filesystem

Run from the user-specified directory or current working directory, excluding managed build directories:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -type d \( -name ".agent-builder" -o -path "*/.local/build" \) \) -prune -o \( -name "*.uipx" -o -name "project.json" -o -name "project.uiproj" -o -name "agent.json" -o -name "*.flow" -o -name "*.bpmn" -o -name "app.config.json" -o -name ".uipath" -o -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "langgraph.json" -o -name "llama_index.json" -o -name "openai_agents.json" -o -name "uipath.json" -o -name "main.py" \) -print 2>/dev/null
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -type d \( -name ".agent-builder" -o -path "*/.local/build" \) \) -prune -o \( -name "*PDD*" -o -name "*pdd*" -o -name "*Process_Design*" -o -name "*process_design*" -o -name "*Process-Design*" -o -name "*ProcessDesign*" -o -name "*SDD*" -o -name "*Solution_Design*" -o -name "*design_document*" -o -name "*DesignDocument*" -o -name "*requirements*" -o -name "*specification*" \) -print 2>/dev/null
```

#### 0b. Locate and Use the PDD

The PDD is the source of truth for process behavior, business context, inputs/outputs, exceptions, SLAs, transactions, queues, applications, credentials, and success criteria. Search in order: `./docs/`, `./documentation/`, `./Design/`, project root; names containing `PDD.*`, `Process_Design_Document.*`, `SDD.*`, `Solution_Design_Document.*`, or `Requirements.*`; root `AGENTS.md` or `README.md`; then `project.json.description` and metadata. Read supported documents with appropriate tools and extract review criteria.

If none is found, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask interactively (do not print the question as prose):

```text
Question: I could not find a Process Design Document (PDD) in this project. Do you have one I can use as the source of truth for this review?
Header: PDD
Options:
  1. Yes, I have a file — provide a path, URL, or Confluence/SharePoint link.
  2. I'll paste the content — provide the PDD or relevant sections.
  3. No, proceed without — review technical quality and best practices only; business-logic alignment cannot be verified.
```

Read supplied or pasted content; if declined, record the limitation. Use the PDD as the primary benchmark.

#### 0c. Determine Scope

Internal labels such as “Path A”, “Path B”, and “Step 3a” must not appear in the final report. Use the user-facing Review Scope vocabulary from Step 5.

**Solution/multi-project scope:** a root `.uipx`, or at least two executable project markers in different subdirectories. Executable markers are `project.json` with `outputType` Process/Tests/unspecified, low-code `agent.json`, coded-agent Python (`pyproject.toml` plus framework or `uipath.json` configuration), `.flow`, or `project.uiproj` with `ProjectType` Flow/ProcessOrchestration/Api. Libraries (`outputType: Library`) do not trigger this scope. Windows-Legacy executables do not trigger `.uipx` scope; do not flag missing `.uipx`, and recommend Modern migration only when solution bundling is desired.

For solution scope, read `.uipx`; find orphan executables; classify all projects; check `config.json`, versions, dependencies, circular dependencies, and cross-project relationships; build a project map; cross-reference the PDD; read [references/solution-review-guide.md](references/solution-review-guide.md); then review each project.

**Single-project scope:** one root project marker, no `.uipx`, and no executable siblings. Classify it, cross-reference the PDD, skip solution checks, and proceed. If given a file, walk upward to its enclosing project and review the full project.

### Step 1 — Classify Project Type and Language

For every project, read `project.json.expressionLanguage` for RPA (`VisualBasic` or `CSharp`) and adapt expression, null/type, string, LINQ, naming, and Unit of Work checks; never assume VB.

| Signal | Type | Checklist/catalog |
|---|---|---|
| `project.json` + `.cs` with `[Workflow]` | RPA (Coded) | [rpa-review-checklist.md](references/rpa/rpa-review-checklist.md) |
| `project.json` + `.xaml` | RPA (XAML) | [rpa-review-checklist.md](references/rpa/rpa-review-checklist.md) |
| absent `targetFramework` or `Legacy` | RPA (Windows-Legacy) | [rpa-review-checklist.md](references/rpa/rpa-review-checklist.md) §10; recommend `uipath-rpa` Legacy mode |
| both `.cs` and `.xaml` | RPA (Hybrid) | RPA checklist |
| DU packages `UiPath.IntelligentOCR.Activities` or `UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.ML.Activities` | RPA + Document Understanding | RPA + [du-review-checklist.md](references/document-understanding/du-review-checklist.md) |
| `agent.json.type == lowCode` | Agent (Low-Code) | [agents-lowcode-rules.md](references/agents/agents-lowcode-rules.md) |
| Python coded-agent signals, including `agent.json.type == coded` | Agent (Coded) | [agents-coded-rules.md](references/agents/agents-coded-rules.md) |
| `*.flow` + `project.uiproj.ProjectType == Flow` | Flow | [flow-review-checklist.md](references/flows/flow-review-checklist.md) |
| `*.bpmn` + `ProjectType == ProcessOrchestration` | Maestro BPMN | [bpmn-review-checklist.md](references/bpmn/bpmn-review-checklist.md) |
| `Workflow.json` with `document.dsl` and `do[]` + `ProjectType == Api` | API Workflow | [api-workflow-review-checklist.md](references/api-workflows/api-workflow-review-checklist.md) |
| `.uipath/` or `app.config.json` | Coded App | [coded-app-review-checklist.md](references/coded-apps/coded-app-review-checklist.md) |

For solutions, record path, type, language, and entry points. Inventory authored files, excluding managed/build/dependency directories:

```bash
find "<PROJECT_DIR>" \( -type d \( -name ".agent-builder" -o -path "*/.local/build" -o -name "node_modules" -o -name ".venv" -o -name "obj" -o -name "bin" \) \) -prune -o -type f -print 2>/dev/null | sort
```

Only this authored-file set is in scope for reading, citation, and metrics.

### Step 2 — Run Automated Validation and Workflow Analyzer

Run commands yourself before manual review, for every project and every RPA entry point. Record all results.

#### 2a. RPA

Read `entryPoints` from `project.json` and run each:

```bash
uip rpa validate --file-path "<ENTRY_FILE>" --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
uip rpa build "<PROJECT_DIR>" --log-level Warn --output json
```

Any entry-point validation error or project build failure means the project is not deployable. Do not validate only `Main.xaml`.

#### 2b. Workflow Analyzer

```bash
uip rpa analyze --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
```

If unavailable, use Analyzer results included by `uip rpa validate`. Report every violation: Error as Critical, Warning as Warning, and Info as Info, preserving rule ID, file, and description. Examples include ST-SEC-007, ST-ANA-005, ST-DBP-003, ST-MRD-011, ST-NMG-001, ST-ANA-003, and ST-ANA-009 when emitted.

#### 2c. Other Types

| Type | Command |
|---|---|
| Agent (Low-Code) | `uip agent refresh "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json`; then `uip agent validate "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` |
| Flow | `uip maestro flow validate "<PROJECT_NAME>.flow" --output json` |
| Maestro BPMN | `uip maestro bpmn validate "<FILE>.bpmn" --output json` |
| API Workflow | `uip api-workflow validate "<WORKFLOW_JSON>" --output json` |
| Coded App | `uip codedapp pack dist --dry-run --output json` |
| Solution | `uip solution pack "<SOLUTION_DIR>" "<OUTPUT_DIR>" --output json` |

Report all severities. API workflow validation is offline; never run `uip api-workflow run`. If older CLI versions lack BPMN or API validation, record unavailable rules under Rules Skipped and use the relevant checklist.

#### 2d. Validation Results

Every report includes:

```markdown
### Automated Validation Results

| Project | Command | Errors | Warnings | Info |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### Validation Details
- [V-E-001] <file>: <rule ID> — <message>
- [V-W-001] <file>: <rule ID> — <message>
```

Include counts for every command. Detail Errors and Warnings only. Do not narrate clean results, passes, zero issues, drift status, scores, regeneration counts, or schema status; the table is sufficient.

### Step 2.5 — Run the Review CLI, Then Apply the Judgment Catalog

Apply to every encountered agent, including late-invoked reviews.

#### 2.5a. Deterministic CLI pass

Run once and capture JSON:

| Type | Command |
|---|---|
| Low-Code | `uip agent review "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` |
| Coded | `uip codedagent review "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` |

Parse `Data.Issues[]` objects `{RuleId, Category, Severity, Description, File, SuggestedFix}` and carry them verbatim. Guardrail configuration validity is CLI-only: run the review CLI or `--checks guardrails` when appropriate, including every emitted `GUARDRAIL_*` finding verbatim; do not eyeball or re-flag CLI guardrail findings.

#### 2.5b. Judgment pass

Load each applicable catalog fully and apply every rule's `detection_method` to its named source material, including prompts, tools, eval datapoints, and schemas. Track intended rules that cannot be applied.

| Signal | Catalog |
|---|---|
| `agent.json.type == lowCode` | `references/agents/agents-lowcode-rules.md` |
| Python coded-agent or `agent.json.type == coded` | `references/agents/agents-coded-rules.md` |
| `pyproject.toml` + `main.py` + `uipath.json[functions]` without framework config | coded catalog |
| `package.json` + `uipath.json[functions]` (no `pyproject.toml`) — Coded Function (JS/TS) | phase 2; no agent catalog |
| RPA, Flow, Coded App | phase 2; no agent catalog |

For guardrails, running the guardrail workflow is **mandatory** whenever `guardrails[]` is non-empty or the use case calls for guardrails — do not eyeball `agent.json`:

- Low-code: **open [guardrails-review.md](references/agents/guardrails/guardrails-review.md) and follow its Step 0 — you MUST run `uip agent guardrails catalog --output json` (30-min cache) and the never-cached tenant `uip agent guardrails list`** before auditing, then apply Audit Mode and Recommend Mode. Emit `LC_GUARDRAIL_ACTION_INEFFECTIVE`, `LC_GUARDRAIL_MISAPPLIED`, and `LC_GUARDRAIL_RECOMMENDED` as applicable.
- Coded: **open [coded-guardrails-review.md](references/agents/guardrails/coded-guardrails-review.md) and follow it** when middleware/decorators are wired or the use case calls for guardrails. Public Python SDK docs may be fetched only when a finding must name classes not visible in source. Emit `CODED_GUARDRAIL_ACTION_INEFFECTIVE`, `CODED_GUARDRAIL_MISAPPLIED`, and `CODED_GUARDRAIL_RECOMMENDED`; do not duplicate CLI IDs `CODED_GUARDRAIL_WRONG_IMPORT`, `CODED_GUARDRAIL_TOOL_SCOPE_NO_TOOLS`, or `CODED_GUARDRAIL_INVALID_CONTRACT`.
- If the guardrail catalog is unavailable, put Audit-Mode rules in Rules Skipped and retain source-only Recommend Mode detection.

Before merging, verify every `rule_id` against a loaded catalog or CLI JSON. Remove absent IDs and retain only a Critical observation; drop unrule'd Warnings and Infos. Merge one row per finding into the Step 5 severity table using `C-D-`, `W-D-`, or `I-D-` prefixes as described in [references/rule-format.md](references/rule-format.md).

### Step 3 — Manual Quality Review

For each project, load its type-specific checklist and inspect only authored files.

#### 3a. Unit of Work Discovery

Derive both the declared contract unit and actual execution unit; do not ask the user. A mismatch is Critical-to-Warning regardless of type.

| Type | Declared unit location |
|---|---|
| RPA with queue | Queue schema or fields used by `Add Queue Item`/`Get Transaction Item` |
| RPA without queue | `Main.xaml` input arguments |
| Flow | `.flow.variables.globals` entries with `in`/`inout` direction |
| Maestro BPMN | Start-event payload/process inputs |
| Low-code agent | `agent.json.inputSchema` |
| Coded agent | `Input` Pydantic `BaseModel` in `main.py` |
| API workflow | `Workflow.json` request schema |
| Coded app | Entry-point schema in `operate.json`/`entry-points.json` |

Find the core execution body and inspect iteration and effects:

```bash
grep -n 'ForEach\|While' <EXECUTION_FILE>
grep -n 'HttpRequest\|Add Queue Item\|InvokeWorkflowFile\|Write Range\|Write Line\|SqlCommand' <EXECUTION_FILE>
```

For coded projects inspect `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and external I/O. Classify:

| Pattern | Shape |
|---|---|
| One invocation causes one atomic external state change | one-to-one |
| Loop over an input collection with external effects in the loop | one-to-many |
| Retry/UI enumeration/in-memory-only loop | one-to-one |
| No loop | one-to-one |
| Contract or execution cannot be mapped deterministically | unclear |

Side effects making a loop one-to-many include invoked side-effect workflows, HTTP/connectors, queue operations (`Add Queue Item`, `Set Transaction Progress`), database writes (`Execute Non Query`, `Insert Data Table`, `Bulk Insert`), non-temporary file writes (`Write Range`, `Write CSV`, `Append to File`), state-changing UI actions (Click submit/save, persistent Type Into, SAP `Call Transaction`), and email sends. Session scope, shared credentials, one portal, PDD wording, idempotency, or queue size do not reclassify the shape.

For one-to-many, determine whether sub-units can be independently queued. If yes, recommend dispatcher/performer splitting. If no, use the 10-point hardening checklist in [rpa-common-issues.md](references/rpa/rpa-common-issues.md) under “When it cannot be split — hardening checklist”; report each missing safeguard separately. Check read-before-write, conditional skips, `UniqueReference`, SQL `MERGE`/`ON CONFLICT`/`UPSERT`/`WHERE NOT EXISTS`, HTTP idempotency headers, status filters, pre-check workflows, and per-sub-item progress.

Severity: splittable with no guards and `MaxRetryNumber < 2` is Critical; splittable with guards but weak progress/output is Warning; unsplittable missing safeguards is Warning–Critical; splittable with guards, retry, and per-item output is Info; unclear mapping is Info. Report one Transaction Shape summary line per project and never create a separate Unit of Work Analysis section.

#### 3b. PDD Alignment

When available, compare business process, inputs/outputs, exceptions/retries, applications, transaction definition, queues, credentials, SLAs/performance, happy-path and exception scenarios, and out-of-scope items. Mismatches are generally Warning; hardcoded credentials are Critical; SLA/performance and out-of-scope concerns are Info. Use a dedicated PDD Alignment section. Without a PDD, state: “No PDD was available for this review. Business logic alignment could not be verified. This review covers technical quality and best practices only.”

#### 3c. Technical Review

Load the applicable checklist. For solutions also read [solution-review-guide.md](references/solution-review-guide.md) for `.uipx`, `config.json`, orphan, dependency, consistency, and architecture checks. Skip `.uipx` checks for Windows-Legacy executables and recommend migration instead.

Consult as applicable: [rpa-advanced-checklist.md](references/rpa/rpa-advanced-checklist.md); [long-running-workflow-issues.md](references/rpa/long-running-workflow-issues.md) for persistence activities or Orchestration Process; [modern-studio-issues.md](references/rpa/modern-studio-issues.md) for Studio 2024.10+; [du-review-checklist.md](references/document-understanding/du-review-checklist.md) when DU packages are present; [rpa-common-issues.md](references/rpa/rpa-common-issues.md); and [flow-common-issues.md](references/flows/flow-common-issues.md).

### Step 4 — Evaluate Optimization

Only after validation and manual review, assess business suitability, architecture, dependencies, queue usage, bulk operations, transaction/error recovery, redundant calls, logging, selectors, files, data handling, configuration consistency, environment separation, and performance. For solutions assess cross-project architecture, pinned libraries, circular dependencies, dispatcher/performer suitability, and shared configuration. For single projects assess queues for more than 50 independent items, batching, REFramework/equivalent retry, resource efficiency, and selector/data patterns. Read [review-workflow-guide.md](references/review-workflow-guide.md) and [architecture-assessment-guide.md](references/architecture-assessment-guide.md).

### Step 4.5 — Compute Agent Grade

Agents only:

```text
Final grade = min(G_det, G_jud)
```

`G_det` is the letter in CLI `Data.Grade`; never recompute it from issue counts. For judgment findings only, calculate `100 − (15 × Criticals) − (4 × Warnings) − (1 × Infos)`, floored at 0; map `85–100 A`, `65–84 B`, `45–64 C`, `25–44 D`, `0–24 F`. Any unmitigated judgment Critical caps at D; a security/data-integrity judgment Critical forces F. Architecture-principle scores do not affect the grade. For multiple agents use the worst grade, never an average. Show the binding constraint, for example `B — gated by G_det = CLI Data.Grade B; judgment clean (G_jud A)`. Use [agent-grading-rubric.md](references/agents/agent-grading-rubric.md) for omissions, edge cases, no-PDD/CLI/no-eval handling, and examples.

### Step 5 — Produce the Review Report

Write the report in chat; **and when the task asks you to save it to a path (e.g. `./_review_report.md`), also write it to that exact path** (≥500 bytes). The read-only rule forbids creating or editing files **inside the project under review** — it does NOT forbid writing the requested report file. Do not use internal labels such as “Path A”, “Path B”, “Step 3a”, or “Step 0c”; do not use “Mismatch”, “Aligned”, “disqualifying criteria”, or “verdict”. Use one-to-one, one-to-many, or unclear. Do not create a Unit of Work Analysis section.

Required sections, in order:

1. `## Review Report: <name>`
2. `### Summary` — render as a **bullet list, not a table**. Bullets: Overall Quality; **Agent Grade** (agents only — exact form `- **Agent Grade:** <A–F> — <verdict>`, letter only, no `+`/`-`, keep any commentary in a later clause); Business Value; Review Scope; Project Types Found; Validation Status; PDD Available; Transaction Shape per project.
3. `### PDD Alignment` — only when a PDD is available.
4. `### Automated Validation Results` — counts table and Error/Warning details only.
5. `### Rules Skipped` — intended but unapplied rules only.
6. `### Critical Findings`, `### Warnings`, `### Improvement Opportunities` — one row per finding: `| <id> | <rule> | <file>: <issue>. <fix>. |`; use `—` when no `rule_id`; never duplicate or split findings by source.
7. `### Per-Project Summary` — Grade for agents and `—` otherwise; Quality for all. Report size as structural counts, never lines: `.xaml` activity/nesting/variable/argument counts, `.cs` method/statement counts, `.flow` node/gateway/depth counts, `.py` function/statement/import counts, config entry/nesting counts.
8. `### Recommended Next Steps` — route fixes to the appropriate skill.
9. `### Optimization Notes` — only when relevant.
10. `**Final grade: <A–F>**` — agents only, on its own line as the **last line** of the report (nothing after it); the letter **must match** the Summary Agent Grade.

Legacy validation status must say: `Use uipath-rpa (Legacy mode) for Legacy-specific validation`. Do not say “Could not run” or “Failed”. Legacy is supported indefinitely in Studio LTS and is not a Critical deployment blocker. Recommend migration based on actual needs. Overall Quality is **Good** for 0 Critical and 0–3 Warnings; **Needs Improvement** for 0 Critical and 4+ Warnings or 1 Critical with a clear fix; **Critical Issues** for 2+ Critical or 1 security/data-integrity Critical. For agents, A/B maps to Good, C/D to Needs Improvement, and F to Critical Issues. Never use “Mismatch” or “Aligned”.

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Never flag Windows-Legacy (absent or `Legacy` `targetFramework`) as a Critical issue** — the Legacy targetFramework itself is never a Critical finding or deployment blocker; it is supported indefinitely in Studio LTS. Flag Warning only when relevant capabilities are missing; otherwise Info. Recommend migration based on actual needs, especially Healing Agent, Unified Target/Modern UIA, Object Repository, ScreenPlay, coded test cases, Autopilot, or Agents/Maestro. Route deep validation to `uipath-rpa` Legacy mode. **On a clean Legacy project, do not let Overall Quality read as "Critical Issues" on account of the Legacy runtime, an incomplete/stubbed integration, or a design gap — those are Warnings unless you have concrete evidence of a shipped security or data-integrity defect. If you do cite a genuine Critical, its recommendation must state plainly that it is unrelated to the Windows-Legacy targetFramework** (never place the Legacy label and a Critical rating together without that disclaimer).
2. Do not recommend removing a dependency until usages have been searched and no consumers remain.
3. Do not flag `-preview` package versions; address stability through activity-owner channels rather than the user-facing report.
4. Do not run scripts or install Python packages. Deterministic checks belong in `uip agent review` or `uip codedagent review`; the skill ships no executable code.
